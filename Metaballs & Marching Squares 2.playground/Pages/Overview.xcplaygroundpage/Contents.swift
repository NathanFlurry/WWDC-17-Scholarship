 # Overview
 
 ## What are metaballs?
 Metaballs are shapes which are used to create organic-looking simulations. Like many other algorithms, metaballs can be expanded into infinite dimensions; however, for the purpose of simplicity, this playground will simply use 2-dimensional metaballs.
 
 ## Simulation usage
 Every simulation in this playground is interactive. For the playgrounds demonstrating metaballs, you can interact with it in these ways:
 * Tap to create new metaballs
 * Drag to move metaballs
 * Double tap to remove metaballs
